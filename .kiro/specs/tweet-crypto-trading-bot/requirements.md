# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a full-stack, production-ready tweet-driven crypto trading bot that monitors social media for crypto-related content, analyzes sentiment, and executes automated trades on Binance Testnet. The system provides real-time monitoring, risk management, and a dashboard interface for oversight and manual controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL start all services using Docker Compose
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the backend SHALL be compatible with serverless platforms like Fly.io or Railway
3. WHEN deploying the frontend THEN it SHALL be compatible with Vercel or similar static hosting platforms
4. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL use environment variables and never commit API keys to version control

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious trader, I want the system to operate on testnet environments and handle API credentials securely, so that I can test strategies without risking real funds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Binance THEN the system SHALL use Binance Testnet API exclusively
2. WHEN storing API credentials THEN they SHALL be managed through environment variables
3. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and error handling
4. WHEN processing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for data handling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want the system to operate within free tier limits of various services, so that I can run the bot without significant ongoing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Twitter API THEN the system SHALL operate within free tier rate limits
2. WHEN using cloud services THEN the system SHALL be configured to use free tiers where available
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL optimize for minimal storage costs
4. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL use free monitoring solutions like Grafana Cloud free tier

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration management, so that I can adjust trading parameters and system behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN signal score thresholds SHALL be managed via environment variables or config files
2. WHEN setting risk parameters THEN position sizing, stop-loss distances, and take-profit levels SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN updating API credentials THEN they SHALL be managed through secure environment variables
4. WHEN changing system behavior THEN configuration updates SHALL take effect without requiring code deployment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle high workloads and scale processing capacity, so that tweet processing doesn't fall behind during high-volume periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workload increases THEN the system SHALL support multiple concurrent Celery workers for parallel processing
2. WHEN processing tweets THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent NLP analysis tasks efficiently
3. WHEN executing trades THEN the system SHALL queue and process trade requests without blocking other operations
4. WHEN scaling workers THEN the system SHALL distribute tasks evenly across available workers

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust error handling and retry mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't cause data loss or missed trading opportunities.
